I am a current undergraduate at the National University of Singapore. I study political science, history, and cybersecurity because I have a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems that plague us.

## Objective

My journey in Political Science has led me to develop a passion for security and specifically cybersecurity because of how transformative it is. I am ever eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
