# Hello! This exists as 'documentation' practice for when I set up Windows virtualisation on an Apple Silicon chip laptop.
## This project is here because I was told documenting was key to success and this was meant to instil the habit of documentation. Moreover, I want to maximise all my resources during my learning journey.
## For this project, I will be setting up a Cybersecurity Homelab on a M2 laptop. I will also be using a Kali laptop to attack and defend against certain threats and vulnerabilities that are typical in Businesses.
## Along the way, I will practice conciousness of the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, & Availability), risk management, and NIST CSF referencing. 
## Ultimately, this project is a step-by-step of what I did, why I did it, and which sources I used to understand my situation.

## Downloaded VMware fusion pro 13 from: https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion
## After installing VMware, I went ahead and chose 'Get Windows from Microsoft', kept it to Windows Professional, and downloaded Windows.
## During the installation process, one could ponder on the meanings of life or just suck their thumb silently...

## Anyways, installation finished, now proceeding forward with auto-generation of password and saving password to keychain.

## Now upon initialization, I changed the processors in settings to reflect half of the machine's total processor cores. 
## (You can verify this step by going to 'About This Mac' --> More Info --> 'System Report' --> Total Number of Cores: N)
## Additionally I used half of the total memory to get maximum performance. Now just proceed as per normal windows boot and load...Once again allowing for further contemplations of life...
